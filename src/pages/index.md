  content: >
    You hire me because you don’t want to worry about all the final details coming together for the actual wedding day.
    Because you’ve purchased everything you can think of for your 80s-themed wedding on Etsy and need someone else to execute it seamlessly.
    Because you’ve answered all of your future mother-in-law’s questions for the past six months and it’s time for someone else to handle her on your big day.
    Because you deserve to know that you have help from a professional in case anything major comes up out of the blue.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
