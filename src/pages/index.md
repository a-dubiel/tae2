    You hire me because you don’t want to worry about all the final details
    coming together for the actual wedding day.


    Because you’ve purchased everything you can think of for your 80s-themed
    wedding on Etsy and need someone else to execute it seamlessly.


    Because you’ve answered all of your future mother-in-law’s questions for the
    past six months and it’s time for someone else to handle her on your big
    day.


    Because you deserve to know that you have help from a professional in case
    anything major comes up out of the blue.

  content: >
    My name is Alice Chi Martin and I’m a busy working mom with two young kids
    and a day job that I love. The first time I helped coordinate a wedding was
    fifteen years ago for my best friend. I have been hooked ever since.


    I LOVE everything about a wedding day - bossing people around, getting to
    know your crazy Aunt Patty and finding solutions for problems that feel like
    the end of the world on the day of.


    There’s nothing better than watching a crazy day with upteenth details going
    off without a hitch - that “wedding high” is addictive and why I keep doing
    this.

    Seeing two families come together and the happiness it brings may sound
    cheesy to some people, but I’m the biggest fan of a rom-com come to life.

        My husband and I left our wedding day with the notion that everything
        went perfectly. The more I spoke with family & friends, the more that
        this notion was confirmed. Many guests + friends raved of Alice and her
        get-sh!t done attitude.
