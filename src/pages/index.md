    You hire me because you don’t want to worry about all the final details
    coming together for the actual wedding day.


    Because you’ve purchased everything you can think of for your 80s-themed
    wedding on Etsy and need someone else to execute it seamlessly.


    Because you’ve answered all of your future mother-in-law’s questions for the
    past six months and it’s time for someone else to handle her on your big
    day.


    Because you deserve to know that you have help from a professional in case
    anything major comes up out of the blue.

about:
  content: >
    My name is Alice Chi Martin and I’m a busy working mom with two young kids
    and a day job that I love. The first time I helped coordinate a wedding was
    fifteen years ago for my best friend. I have been hooked ever since.


    I LOVE everything about a wedding day - bossing people around, getting to
    know your crazy Aunt Patty and finding solutions for problems that feel like
    the end of the world on the day of.


    There’s nothing better than watching a crazy day with upteenth details going
    off without a hitch - that “wedding high” is addictive and why I keep doing
    this.

    Seeing two families come together and the happiness it brings may sound
    cheesy to some people, but I’m the biggest fan of a rom-com come to life.

        "Once our wedding day arrived, Alice was already 10 steps ahead of
        everyone else, including us! She had the run of show memorized, the
        set-up flow planned out perfectly, plus, she’d introduced herself to all
        our vendors, key friends and family without us having to do a thing!"

        "You want your wedding day to be flawless, but a lot of times there’s
        little unexpected glitches along the way. Alice has a plan for
        everything and makes sure you have nothing to worry about except
        enjoying your perfect wedding day. She is the BEST!"

        "My husband and I left our wedding day with the notion that everything
        went perfectly. The more I spoke with family and friends, the more that
        this notion was confirmed. Many guests and friends raved of Alice and
        her organized, get-sh!t done attitude."
